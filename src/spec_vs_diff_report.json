  "summary": "Implemented an AgriTechBanner component and rendered it on role dashboards, and added a RoleLogo in the TopBar. However, the GreenX wordmark visibility issue on the primary-colored TopBar is not fully fixed (\"Green\" still uses text-primary on a bg-primary), and the required generated image assets are not shown as added under frontend/public/assets/generated. Several unrelated admin/data/UI enhancements were also introduced that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the GreenX wordmark so the full title (“GreenX”) is visible in all places it is used (Login header, authenticated TopBar, AdminLayout sidebar header), including on the TopBar where the background is primary-colored and “Green” currently becomes invisible.",
      "reason": "On the authenticated TopBar, the wordmark still renders “Green” with className=\"text-primary\" while the TopBar background is \"bg-primary\", so “Green” can remain invisible on that primary-colored background. The change only adjusts the “X” color via the new variant, not “Green”.",

      "requirement": "Add the newly generated images to the project as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and update the UI to reference those exact filenames directly from the frontend.",
      "reason": "UI code references /assets/generated/*.png, but the diff summary does not show any new image files added under frontend/public/assets/generated (only TSX/CSS files were added/modified).",
